    message : "Abde is an extremely dedicated and talented MERN stack developer who displayed great professionalism and was able to offer valuable insights and suggestions throughout the project. We went through several iterations and he made sure to deliver exactly what I wanted no matter how many times he had to change the code. His communication in English is great and that really helped with conveying the requirements to him and him delivering exactly what was needed. What I appreciated the most is his positive attitude and willingness to go the extra mine to ensure that the project was a success. Abde was an absolute pleasure to work with, and someone I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for talented MERN stack developer. I look forward to working with him in the future." ,
